[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTYlqC_JacQ&t=0) Make sure you pick a bench that gets you your best possible bicep stretch at the bottom, that's really up to you. Feel free to experiment. Otherwise, full range of motion no swing and make sure to get all the way down at the bottom for a deep stretch.
