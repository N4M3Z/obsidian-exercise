[00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zPXlvQZ0B0&t=10) With the seated cable version stretch toward the machine and then straighten your back. With the standing version you can start assisted but the idea is to handle your body's own weight. Then, the wider your feet go, the stronger your groin has to be. With the cable version I use about half my body's weight and I maintain a goal of being able to touch my head to the floor.
