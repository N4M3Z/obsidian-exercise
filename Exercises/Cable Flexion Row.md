[00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkJ-K8KNtYY&t=0) In the cable flexion row we're going to start all the way at the bottom with a rounded back the whole back is rounded over and then we're going to row and arch our chest up the entire time that we're rowing big chest up and touch and pause at the tummy every single time round over under control full stretch and then a big arch at the top just like that.
