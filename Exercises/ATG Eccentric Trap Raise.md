[00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh0cPIhRYxs&t=15) Get the dumbbells into position as if you're going to press over your head. Now, instead of pressing straight overhead, press at a 45Â° angle you're trying to make your body a straight line and then control down at least 5 seconds without bending the elbows.

[00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh0cPIhRYxs&t=50) The standard I maintain is 10% of my body weight per hand for at least five reps going at least 5 seconds down.
